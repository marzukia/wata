# Background

A friend linked me to the following video: [Exposing FRAUD And DECEPTION In The Retro Video Game Market](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rvLFEh7V18A). This video by Karl Jobst deeply covers some funky things going on with Heritage Auctions and Wata (a video game grading agency).

One of the issues highlighted was that Wata had released no population report, which means that the overall rarity of graded items is incredibly opaque. Given Wata's significant influence on the price of collectable games, this seems like a massive issue, and I'm not too fond of the lack of transparency from Wata.

Following the video, I spent 15 minutes writing a script to pull down all available auction data from Heritage Auctions. I spent another 30 minutes writing a script to refine this data.

This data is now available for anyone to use and collected as of the 5th September 2021.

# Limitations

There is no unique identifier within the listings that is easily accessible. Images show the reverse of the game with a unique ID, but this can be distorted by people re-casing these games repeatedly.

This data should be treated as a quasi-population report; the volume of transactions should hopefully give you a proxy for actual market quantities.

# Reusing the Data

Feel free to use the data in any way you wish; credit would be appreciated.
